Well, at least in an alpha state...","text":"<p>The project has seen a complete rewrite of the script from scratch in Python. It requires Python 3.8 or newer to run. Because this update is still in an alpha state, bugs may or will occur. During startup, you will be asked if you want to start the new version 6 or the old version 5. As long as version 6 is in a pre-release state, version 5 will still be available. If there are any critical issues with the new version that were overlooked, you can always switch back to the old version.</p> <p>In case you selected not to get asked about which version to start (option 3 or 4 in the startup dialog) and you want to revert that decision, you will find a line called <code>version_to_launch=</code> within the <code>.kiauh.ini</code> file in your home directory. Just delete that line, save the file and restart KIAUH. KIAUH will then ask you again which version you want to start.</p> <p>Here is a list of the most important changes to KIAUH in regard to version 6: - The majority of features available in KIAUH v5 are still available; they just got migrated from Bash to Python. - It is now possible to add new/remove instances to/from existing multi-instance installations of Klipper and Moonraker - KIAUH now has an Extension-System. This allows contributors to add new installers to KIAUH without having to modify the main script.     - You will now find some of the features that were previously available in the Installer-Menu in the Extensions-Menu.     - The current extensions are:         - G-Code Shell Command (previously found in the Advanced-Menu)         - Mainsail Theme Installer (previously found in the Advanced-Menu)         - Klipper-Backup (new in v6!)         - Moonraker Telegram Bot (previously found in the Installer-Menu)         - PrettyGCode for Klipper (previously found in the Installer-Menu)         - Obico for Klipper (previously found in the Installer-Menu)     - The following additional extensions are planned, but not yet available:         - Spoolman (available in v5 in the Installer-Menu)         - OctoApp (available in v5 in the Installer-Menu) - KIAUH has its own config file now     - The file has some default values for the currently supported options     - There might be more options in the future     - It is located in KIAUH's root directory and is called <code>default.kiauh.cfg</code>         - DO NOT EDIT the default file directly, instead make a copy of it and call it <code>kiauh.cfg</code>         - Settings changed via the Advanced-Menu will be written to the <code>kiauh.cfg</code> - Support for OctoPrint was removed</p> <p>Feel free to give version 6 a try and report any bugs or issues you encounter!

If you are interested in the details, check out this PR: https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker/pull/491 \\ Although Moonraker has some mechanics available to migrate existing setups to the new file structure with the use of symlinks, fresh and clean installs should be considered.</p> <p>The version jump of KIAUH to v5 is a breaking change due to those major changes! That means v4 and v5 are not compatible with each other! This is also the reason why you will currently be greeted by a yellow notification in the main menu of KIAUH leading to this changelog. I decided to disable a few functions of the script and focus on releasing the required changes to the core components of this script. I will work on updating the other parts of the script piece by piece during the next days/weeks. So I am already sorry in advance if one of your desired components you wanted to install or use temporarily cannot be installed or used right now.</p> <p>The following functions are currently unavailable: - Installation of: KlipperScreen, Obico, Octoprint, MJPG-Streamer, Telegram Bot and PrettyGCode - All backup functions and the Log-Upload</p> <p>So what is working?\\ Installation of Klipper, Moonraker, Mainsail and Fluidd. Both, single and multi-instance setups work!\\ As already said, the rest will follow in the near future. Updating and removal of already installed components should continue to work.</p> <p>What was removed?\\ The option to change Klippers configuration directory got removed. From now on it will not be possible anymore to change the configuration directory from within KIAUH and the new filestructure is enforced.</p> <p>What if I don't have an existing Klipper/Moonraker install right now?\\ Nothing important to think about, install Klipper and Moonraker. KIAUH will install both of them with the new filestructure.</p> <p>What if I have an existing Klipper/Moonraker install?\\ First of all: Backups! Please copy all of your config files and the Moonraker database (it is a hidden folder, usually <code>~/.moonraker_database</code>) to a safe location. After that, uninstall Klipper and Moonraker with KIAUH. You can then proceed and re-install both of them with KIAUH again. It is important that you are on KIAUH v5 for that! Once everything is installed again, you need to manually copy your configuration files from the old <code>~/klipper_config</code> folder to the new <code>~/printer_data/config</code> folder. Previous, by Moonraker created symlinks to folder of the old filestructure will not work anymore, you need to move the files to their new location now! Do the same with the two files inside of <code>~/.moonraker_database</code>. Move/copy them into <code>~/printer_data/database</code>. If <code>~/printer_data/database</code> is already populated with a <code>data.mdb</code> and <code>lock.mdb</code> delete them or simply overwrite them. Nothing should be lost as those should be empty database files. Anyway, you made backups, right? You can now proceed and restart Moonraker. Either from within Mainsail or Fluidd, or use SSH and execute <code>sudo systemctl restart moonraker</code>. If everything went smooth, you should be good to go again. If you see some Moonraker warnings about deprecated options in the <code>moonraker.conf</code>, go ahead and resolve them. I will not cover them in detail here. A good source is the Moonraker documentation: https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/</p> <p>What if I have an existing Klipper/Moonraker multi-instance install?\\ Pretty much the same steps that are required for single instance installs apply to multi-instance setups. So please go ahead and read the previous paragraph if you didn't already. Make backups of everything first. Then remove and install the desired amount of Klipper and Moonraker instances again. Now you need to move all config and database files to their new locations.\\ Example with an instance called <code>printer_1</code>:\\ The config files go from <code>~/klipper_config/printer_1</code> to <code>~/printer_1_data/config</code>. The database files go from <code>~/.moonraker_database_1</code> to <code>~/printer_1_data/database</code>. Now restart all Moonraker services. You can restart all of them at once if you launch KIAUH, and in the main menu type <code>restart moonraker</code> and hit Enter.</p> <p>I hope I have covered the most important things. In case you need further support, the official Klipper Discord is a good place to ask for help.</p>"},{"location":"development/changelog/#2022-08-15","title":"2022-08-15","text":"<p>Support for \"Obico for Klipper\" was added!

KIAUH v3.0 is out.\\ With this update you can now install multiple instances of Klipper, Moonraker, Duet Web Control or Octoprint on the same Pi. This was quite a big rework of the whole script. So bugs can appear but with the help of some testers, i think there shouldn't be any critical ones anymore. In this regards thanks to @lixxbox and @zellneralex for testing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Important changes to how installations are set up now: All components get installed as systemd services. Installation via init.d was dropped completely! This shouldn't affect you at all, since the common linux distributions like RaspberryPi OS or custom distributions like MainsailOS, FluiddPi or OctoPi support both ways of installing services. I just wanted to mention it here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now with KIAUH v3.0 and multi-instance installation capabilities, there are some things to point out. You will now need to tell KIAUH where your printers configurations are located when installing Klipper for the first time. Even though it is not recommended, you can change this location with the help of KIAUH and rewrite Klipper and Moonraker to use the new location.</p> </li> <li> <p>When setting up a multi-instance system, the folder structure will only change slightly. The goal was to keep it as compatible as possible with the custom distributions like mainsailOS and FluiddPi. This should help converting a single-instance setup of mainsailOS/FluiddPi to a multi-instance setup in no time, but keeping single-instance backwards compatibility if needed at a later point in time.</p> </li> <li> <p>The folder structure is as follows when setting up multi-instances:\\ Each printer instance will get its own folder within your configuration location. The decision to this specific structure was made to make it as painless and easy as possible to convert to a multi-instance setup. Here is an example:     <pre><code>/home/&lt;username&gt;\n          \u2514\u2500\u2500 klipper_config\n              \u251c\u2500\u2500 printer_1\n              \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 printer.cfg\n              \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 moonraker.conf\n              \u251c\u2500\u2500 printer_2\n              \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 printer.cfg\n              \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 moonraker.conf\n              \u2514\u2500\u2500 printer_n\n                  \u251c\u2500\u2500 printer.cfg\n                  \u2514\u2500\u2500 moonraker.conf\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Also when setting up multi-instances of each service, the name of each service slightly changes. Each service gets its corresponding instance added to the service filename.</p> <p>This only applies to multi-instances! Single instance installations with KIAUH will keep their original names!</p> <p>Corresponding to the filetree example from above that would mean: <pre><code>Klipper services:\n        --&gt; klipper-1.service\n        --&gt; klipper-2.service\n        --&gt; klipper-n.service\n\nMoonraker services:\n        --&gt; moonraker-1.service\n        --&gt; moonraker-2.service\n        --&gt; moonraker-n.service\n</code></pre> * The same service file rules from above apply to OctoPrint even though only Klipper and Moonraker are shown in this example.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can start, stop and restart all Klipper, Moonraker and OctoPrint instances from the KIAUH main menu. For doing this, just type \"stop klipper\", \"start moonraker\", \"restart octoprint\" and so on.</p> </li> <li> <p>KIAUH v3.0 relocated its ini-file. It is now a hidden file in the users home-directory calles <code>.kiauh.ini</code>. This has the benefit of keeping all values in that file between possible re-installations of KIAUH. Otherwise that file would be lost.</p> </li> <li> <p>The option of adding more trusted clients to the moonraker.conf file was dropped. Since you can edit this file right inside of Mainsail or Fluidd, only some basic entries are made which get you running.</p> </li> <li> <p>I bet i have missed mentioning other stuff as well because it took me quite some time to re-write many functions. So i just hope you like the new version \ud83d\ude04</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"development/changelog/#2020-11-28","title":"2020-11-28","text":"<ul> <li>KIAUH now supports the installation, update and removal of KlipperScreen.
